In fact, I love to constantly set goals for myself to achieve in order to stimulate my personal and educational growth. \n I consider myself a curious person and always looking for the best possible result. These characteristics often lead me to inform myself independently to discover new things and put my whole self into what I do. \n Characteristically, I am very sunny, empathetic and friendly, characteristics that make it very easy for me to fit into a group of people. I prefer teamwork over individual work as I firmly believe that improvement comes from continuous comparison with colleagues and friends. For this very reason, I like to put myself on the line and question myself in order to improve my personal and educational growth. \n I possess a natural predisposition for leadership as I possess excellent organizational and communication skills. In fact, I firmly believe that organization and planning are the basis of all success in order to enjoy maximum results.",
